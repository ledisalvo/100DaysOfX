# 100DaysOfHealt - R1 :heart:

The goal of this challenge is to feel good, to enjoy life and be active - not to lose a certain amount of weight, a certain number of kilos. That’s why it’s called #100DaysOfHealth, not of #100DaysOfDiet (which I do not support) or something similar.

# Rules
For the next 100 Days:

1. I will keep a daily log and on Sundays I will check rule by rule for review.  :pencil2:

2. I will tweet an update daily with the hashtags: #100DaysOfHealth #100DaysOfX and a day on which I am on, and with my thoughts/feelings on that day  :bird:

3. I will encourage at least 2 other people in the challenge daily  :smile:

4. I will work out at least 3 times a week  :muscle:

5. I will make an effort to buy healthy food  :apple: (groceries) and to cook at home as much as I can. :fork_and_knife:

6. I will NOT eat any junk food :fries: (e.g. chips, ice-cream, instant noodles, candies, etc.)

7. I will NOT weigh myself during the challenge.

8. I will NOT drink sugary drinks  :candy: as they are often a hidden source of an enormous amount of sugar we get daily – which means: soda (pop), juices, sweet coffee/tea drinks.

9. I will no smoking :smoking:

10. I will NOT drink alcoholic drinks, but if I want it I could drink a maximum of: 1 cup of wine :wine_glass: or 500 ml of beer  :beer: per week.
    
Rules are rules, but if one day I have a huge craving for some specific type of food or drink, I will allow myself to eat it. The catch is that it will be a small amount.
