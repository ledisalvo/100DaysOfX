# The Way it Works
It’s super simple – You choose what habit you want to work on, and commit to working on it in some way for the next 100 days, while holding yourself publicly accountable by tweeting daily updates using the hashtags.

This site is where you can learn the rules, get answers to your questions by reading the FAQ, and find out more about the community that’s growing around the challenges.

# Three Main Rules For the Challenges
Most of the challenges fall under the category of 3 main rules:

1.  Work on your habit for minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days*
2.  Tweet your progress every day with the #100DaysOfX hashtag and the hashtag of your chosen challenge
3.  Encourage/help at least 2 people in the challenge every day
