# The Way it Works
It’s super simple – You choose what habit you want to work on, and commit to working on it in some way for the next 100 days, while holding yourself publicly accountable by tweeting daily updates using the hashtags.

This site is where you can learn the rules, get answers to your questions by reading the FAQ, and find out more about the community that’s growing around the challenges.
