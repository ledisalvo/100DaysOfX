# 100DaysOfHealt - R1 :heart:

The goal of this challenge is to feel good, to enjoy life and be active - not to lose a certain amount of weight, a certain number of kilos. That’s why it’s called #100DaysOfHealth, not of #100DaysOfDiet (which I do not support) or something similar.

# Rules
For the next 100 Days:

1. I will keep a daily log and I will post in Twitter the summary of the day, every day  :pencil2:

2. Sleep at least 6 hours  :zzz:

3. Meditate at least 15 minutes for a day  :om:

4. I will work out 6 times a week. Monday to Saturday. Sunday will be for rest  :muscle:

5. I will make an effort to cook at home as much as I can :fork_and_knife:. If not, I will buy healthy food  :apple:

6. I will NOT eat any junk food :fries: (e.g. chips, ice-cream, cookies, candies, any food with sugar, etc.)

7. I will NOT weigh myself during the challenge.

8. I will NOT drink sugary drinks  :candy: as they are often a hidden source of an enormous amount of sugar we get daily – which means: soda (pop), juices, sweet coffee/tea drinks.

9. I will NOT smoke :smoking:

10. I will NOT drink alcoholic drinks, but if I want it I could drink a maximum of: 1 cup of wine :wine_glass: or 500 ml of beer  :beer: per week.
    
Rules are rules, but if one day I have a huge craving for some specific type of food or drink, I will allow myself to eat it. The catch is that it will be a small amount.
